# American-Sign-Language-Detection
ASL Detection: GitHub project using MediaPipe for landmark detection to convert American Sign Language gestures into numpy arrays for LSTM input, enabling real-time sign language interpretation.
Features:

MediaPipe Landmark Detection: This project employs the power of Google's MediaPipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time video input. This allows us to precisely capture hand gestures and their movements.

Data Preprocessing: The detected hand landmarks are transformed into a structured dataset, specifically a NumPy array, making it suitable for training and input to the LSTM model. The dataset includes time sequences of hand positions to capture dynamic aspects of sign language.

LSTM Sign Recognition: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to process the sequential hand landmark data and recognize ASL signs. LSTM networks excel in capturing the temporal dependencies of data, making them a robust choice for sign language recognition.

Real-Time Sign Detection: The ASL detection system operates in real-time, providing immediate feedback for sign language communication. It visualizes the detected ASL signs on the video feed, making it accessible for users to see their communication.

Model Training and Evaluation: The project includes pre-trained models for sign language detection, but users can train their own models using custom datasets if desired. Model evaluation metrics and guidelines are also provided to assess the model's performance.

User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is designed for easy interaction with the system. Users can start the application, select the desired language, and initiate real-time ASL detection with just a few clicks.

Getting Started:

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies and libraries specified in the project's README.
Run the project's main script to initiate the ASL detection system.
Interact with the application through the GUI, or modify the code to integrate the system into your own applications.
Contributions:

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can help improve the accuracy of sign recognition, expand the supported sign languages, enhance the user interface, or contribute to the documentation.
